What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
If you merge branch A into branch B, then branch B gets a new
commit containing all the new changes from branch A.
If you rebase branch B onto branch A, then the entire history of
branch B gets rewritten to pretend that it started at the head of
branch A.
What is a remote repository?
A remote repository is where your code is stored so you and
everyone working on your project can access it online.
